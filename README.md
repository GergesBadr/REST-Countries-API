# REST-Countries-API

Explore the world with my React app! in a user-friendly interface you will discover all needed information, easily!
Here is the challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca/hub) 

## Features

- Up-to-date information about all the countries.
- Fully responsive.
- Filter countries by region.
- Search for a specific country.
- Click on a country and get more information about it.
- Color theme switcher.

## What I have added?

- To make the challenge more interesting, I decided to add something to it. there is +250 country in the app, would it be a nice user-experience to display all of them in one page? I don't think so. So I added a pagination logic, with almost 16 country in every page. Now you can focus only on this small amount of data on the screen, then you can go to the next page and discover more.
- Instead of display the countries randomly, I sorted them alphabetically.
- Added an error page for users that goes to a wrong page or a page that doesn't exist, guiding them going back to Home page.
- Added a loader indicator while fetching data. also an error indicator if something wrong happens in the process
